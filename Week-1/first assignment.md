Ans. Protocol Stack is also known as OSI layers and it help to make a connection between user and server. Different layer has their own feature and work.
Physical layer is user for user connection means how user is connected
Network layers is user for converting human readable language to IP so we can find the result easily.
In web development protocol stack is widely use like TCP which comes in transport layer and it used for transporting a data in small packet and if any data in lost then in will retransmitted.

2.	What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?
Ans. Every website in the computer is webserver. This server is always connected to internet and every web server that is connected to internet is given a unique address that made up series of 4 numbers and we called it IP. In the market there are different type of webserver are available with different functionality.
Apache HTTP server. This is open webserver and it know for its flexibility and reliability, and it can support variety of operating system and Apache server support different modules like SSL/TLS.
Nginx. This is light weight, high performance server that support static content and it is also used in load balancing and good for high traffic website.
Microsoft IIS. This webserver is developed by Microsoft to run on windows and it work on technologies like .NET and ASP.NET and it support SSL/TLS.

Ans. Scaling is the process of increasing capacity of system and application so that they can handle large no of users, requests and transaction there are two type of scaling vertical scaling and horizontal scaling.
Vertical scaling. In vertical scaling we increase capacity os the server by adding Ram, adding CPU cores and by upgrading storage till the time we reach maximum capacity of the server.
Horizontal scaling. In this scaling we directly added more server to a system rather then just adding more resource to a single server and horizontal scaling is more scalable then vertical scaling and horizontal scaling can handle large no or users and requests by distributing the load equally into the multiple server.
