            <p>'m Nobody! Who are you? <br>
                Are you - Nobody - Too? <br>
                Then there's a pair of us!br <br>
                Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
            </p>
            <p>How dreary - to be - Somebody! <br>
                How public - like a Frog - <br>
                To tell one's name - the livelong June - <br>
                To an admiring Bog!
